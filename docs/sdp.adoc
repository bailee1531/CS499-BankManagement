== Project Overview
=== Project Description
The Bank Management Utility (BANK) is a secure, web-based application that helps banks manage customer accounts. It supports three main user roles: *Customers*, *Tellers*, and *Administrators*, each with specific access and responsibilities. This system supports multiple account types, such as checking, savings, money market, home mortgage loans, and credit card accounts, incorporating features like deposit and withdrawal tracking, fund transfers, and online bill payments, all within a secure, user-friendly interface.

Prioritizing security, the system includes robust authentication, encrypted data handling, and role-based access controls to ensure that sensitive customer information remains protected at all times. Error handling and transaction validation further enhance the security of the application.

=== Project Objectives
.*Secure User Access*
* Use secure login credentials for all users (username and password).
* Implement encrypted data storage and transfer to safeguard sensitive information.

.*Support Key User Roles*
* Customer: Create and manage personal accounts, view transaction reports, transfer funds, and pay bills.
* Teller: Manage customer accounts, handle transactions, and review account data.
* Administrator: Oversee teller accounts and access all system data for maintenance.

.*Include Core Banking Features*
* Support multiple account types with unique features like interest rates and monthly payments.
* Facilitate deposits, withdrawals, and transfers while enforcing restrictions for certain account types.

.*Ensure Usability*
* Provide a simple, intuitive interface suitable for non-technical users.
* Design the system to handle errors and recover from input mistakes.

.*Enable Scalability*
* Allow multiple users to access the system at the same time.
* Support future updates, such as adding more account types or enhancing security.

.*Use Reliable Data Management*
* Store account data in a secure database or similar storage system for real-time access and updates.
